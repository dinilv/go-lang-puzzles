/* Tower of Hanoi, is a mathematical puzzle which consists of three towers (pegs) and more than one rings. 
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. 
Here is source code of the Go Program to implement Tower of Hanoi Algorithm.
